  Flyfish Viewer is an offline-first frontend file preview system for web applications.
  It is designed for attachment centers, workflow tools, knowledge bases, support portals, and self-hosted intranet products that need broad file coverage without running a document conversion backend.
  The current format matrix covers 208 file extensions across 25 preview pipelines.

## Positioning

Flyfish Viewer is not trying to replace specialist editors. It gives business products a practical, embedded preview layer for common and uncommon attachments: documents, spreadsheets, slides, PDFs, archives, email, diagrams, CAD drawings, 3D assets, code, logs, media, and data files.

The project keeps a pure TypeScript core under `@file-viewer/core`, split renderer packages for heavier formats, native component packages for Web Components, Vue, React, jQuery, and Svelte, and product-shaped presets for common capability sets.

The 2.1.0 architecture is modular by default: use minimal renderer imports when you need one exact format, or choose `preset-lite`, `preset-office`, `preset-engineering`, or `preset-all` when your product needs a composed capability set. In Vite projects, `@file-viewer/vite-plugin` auto-discovers installed presets and injects the capability layer, so most teams do not hand-write renderer imports.

For pages with uncontrolled global CSS, use the Web Component / IIFE default Shadow DOM isolation or pass `options.styleIsolation:'shadow'` from framework packages. Theme customization should use `--file-viewer-*` tokens and stable `::part()` surfaces.

For heavy users that need everything immediately, use the native Full package. It already includes `preset-all`; do not install or pass another preset:

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/vue3-full
npm install -D @file-viewer/vite-plugin # Vite
```

```ts
fileViewerRenderers({ copyAssets: true })
```

Vite publishes complete assets in both dev and build. Webpack, Vue CLI, Rspack, Rollup, Umi, and other non-Vite projects run the same-version CLI included by the Full package:

```bash
npx --no-install file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer
```

Script-tag deployments can publish the complete `@file-viewer/web-full/dist/` directory without a copy step.
