# FAQ

> **Maintainer-only commands:** this page contains complete-workspace release or verification examples that are not part of the public checkout. Public contributors should use the commands in `/README.md` or `/docs/guide/development.md`.

<!-- FILE_VIEWER_MAINTAINER_COMMANDS -->

## The viewer is blank

Confirm the host container has a stable height and the file has a recognizable extension or explicit `type`.

## A worker or WASM file does not load

Run:

```bash
npx --yes file-viewer-copy-assets@2.1.27 ./public/file-viewer
```

Then confirm your server returns the correct MIME type for `.wasm`, `.js`, fonts, and JSON manifests. Strict CSP deployments should serve all viewer assets from the same trusted origin.

## Why does vue-full still say the libarchive Worker did not load?

Since `2.1.20`, `@file-viewer/vue3-full`, `@file-viewer/vue2.7-full`, and `@file-viewer/vue2.6-full` point Archive, PDF, DOCX, Excel, PPTX, CAD, Typst, Draw.io, SQLite, and related offline assets to `/file-viewer/` by default. In production, confirm these two URLs return the real JavaScript/WASM files instead of a 404 page or an SPA HTML fallback:

- `/file-viewer/vendor/libarchive/worker-bundle.js`
- `/file-viewer/vendor/libarchive/libarchive.wasm`

If your static prefix is not `/file-viewer/`, set it once during startup:

```ts
import { setDefaultFullAssetBaseUrl } from '@file-viewer/vue3-full'

setDefaultFullAssetBaseUrl('/your-static-prefix/')
```

The compatibility-mode notice does not mean ZIP/TAR/GZIP are unusable. It means the libarchive Worker could not start, so RAR, 7z, encrypted archives, and other libarchive-only formats still need the Worker/WASM assets. ZIP, TAR, and GZIP continue through the compatibility path, and legacy GBK/GB18030 Chinese ZIP entry names stay readable there.

## npm 11 fails with `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'matches')`

This is usually not a `@file-viewer/*` version mismatch. We verify npm 11.17.0 against a clean registry install and a local tgz dependency-closure install for `@file-viewer/vue3 + @file-viewer/preset-office`.

The message is an npm Arborist crash while building the dependency tree. The most common trigger is a project directory whose `node_modules` was created by pnpm, bun, vlt, or another package manager, followed by `npm install` in the same directory. npm may hit a store-style symlink with a null target and throw this internal `matches` TypeError.

Use one package manager per project and reset the install directory:

```bash
# If the project uses npm
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json npm-shrinkwrap.json
npm cache verify
npm install
```

```bash
# If the project uses pnpm, keep using pnpm
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
pnpm install
```

For offline tgz installs, the top-level tgz still needs all runtime dependencies to resolve from npm, a private registry, or sibling local tarballs. In intranet environments, publish the same-version `@file-viewer/vue3`, the selected preset, its renderer packages, and `@file-viewer/core` to a private registry, or declare the local tgz dependency closure together.

Release verification includes:

```bash
pnpm verify:npm-install-smoke
```

## Can I deploy without public CDNs?

Yes. Runtime assets are designed to be self-hosted. Draw.io, Typst, CAD, Archive, PDF, DOCX, Spreadsheet, SQLite, and other heavy assets can be copied into your own static directory.

## Why does every format not expose every toolbar action?

Each renderer reports operation availability. Download is usually available, but print, HTML export, search, zoom, page navigation, and text anchors depend on the active renderer.

## Should I use an iframe?

No for standard package integrations. Use the native package for your stack. iframe-style demos can still be useful for embedding the full hosted demo, but the core product path is native and debuggable.
