# Ecosystem Packages

<div class="doc-kicker">Native Package Lines</div>

<p class="doc-lead">
  New integrations should prefer the standard <code>@file-viewer/*</code> packages.
  Historical <code>@flyfish-group/*</code> names remain available for existing users.
  Each package line keeps the host framework native while presets and renderers make format capability and install boundaries explicit.
  The v2.2.0 release maintains 54 npm targets over one 208-extension, 25-pipeline capability matrix.

## Recommended Packages

Standard component packages are intentionally light. Installing `@file-viewer/vue3`, `@file-viewer/react`, `@file-viewer/web`, `@file-viewer/svelte`, `@file-viewer/jquery`, or a Vue 2 package gives you the native ecosystem component, types, controller APIs, and the core foundation. Real format coverage is assembled by presets or individual renderer packages.

| Strategy | Install | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lightest component entry | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3` | Add format capability only after the component shell is wired |
| Lightweight attachments | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-lite` | Text, Markdown, code, image, audio, video; pass the preset through `options.preset` |
| Office document platform | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-office` | PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OFD, RTF, OpenDocument; recommended default for document apps |
| Engineering platform | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-engineering` | CAD, 3D, drawing, XMind, Geo, Typst, Archive, Data, EDA |
| Full demo capability | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-all` | One-step full capability for demos, admin tools, and internal all-format workbenches |
| Full package | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3-full` | Enables `preset-all` by default, no manual `options.preset` needed |
| CDN full trial | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@file-viewer/web-full@latest/dist/flyfish-file-viewer-web-full.iife.js` | Script-tag validation with lazy renderers and packaged binary-PPT 0.3.1 assets |
| Strict custom cut | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/renderer-pdf` | Install one renderer and pass it through `options.renderers` |

## Full Package Asset Contract

Since `2.1.30`, all eight Full packages share one delivery contract. They include and enable `preset-all` together with version-aligned renderer, Worker, WASM, font, Draw.io, SQLite, and other vendor assets; Vite or the included CLI publishes that payload on the application's own origin. Version `2.2.0` includes the verified binary `.ppt` 0.3.1 runtime under `vendor/ppt/`.

| Build path | Complete deployment |
| --- | --- |
| Vite | Register `fileViewerRenderers({ copyAssets:true })`; the plugin recognizes the installed Full package and serves/copies all assets in both dev and build |
| Webpack, Vue CLI, Rspack, Rollup, Umi, other bundlers | Run `npx --no-install file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer`; the binary is included by the Full package at the same version |
| Script tag / CDN | Use jsDelivr/unpkg directly or deploy the complete `@file-viewer/web-full/dist/` directory; no copy command is required |

Do not install another `preset-all` or a separately versioned asset copier next to a Full package. All Full packages default to `file-viewer/` under the deployment base; use `setDefaultFullAssetBaseUrl('/your-prefix/')` only when your static directory differs.

`options.preset` is the bundler-neutral assembly path. Webpack, Rspack, Rollup, Umi, classic multi-page apps, micro-frontends, and internal component libraries can import a preset explicitly and pass it to the component:

```ts
import officePreset from '@file-viewer/preset-office'

const viewerOptions = {
  preset: officePreset,
  rendererMode: 'replace'
}
```

Vite projects can additionally install `@file-viewer/vite-plugin` to remove manual imports. Vite plugins still need to be registered once in `vite.config.ts`; after that, `fileViewerRenderers()` or `fileViewerRenderers({ copyAssets:true })` auto-discovers installed `@file-viewer/preset-*` packages and injects the generated virtual module into Vite HTML entrypoints. Components keep `autoRenderers:true` by default, so Vue, React, Svelte, jQuery, and Vanilla JavaScript / Pure Web receive the matching preview capability automatically. `preset-all` is intentionally complete and therefore heavier; production apps should normally prefer `preset-lite`, `preset-office`, `preset-engineering`, or individual renderers.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { fileViewerRenderers } from '@file-viewer/vite-plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    fileViewerRenderers({
      copyAssets: true
      // Installed presets are activated automatically; no hand-written import or renderers prop.
    })
  ]
}
```

## Renderer Packages

Heavy renderers are split so applications can install only what they need:

- `@file-viewer/renderer-pdf`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-word`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-ofd`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-presentation`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-cad`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-typst`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-archive`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-email`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-epub`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-text`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-image`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-media`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-mindmap`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-geo`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-drawing`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-3d`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-data`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-eda`

Standard component packages depend on the lightweight core foundation by default.
Install only the renderer packages your product needs, use `@file-viewer/preset-lite` / `@file-viewer/preset-office` / `@file-viewer/preset-engineering` for product-shaped bundles, or pass `@file-viewer/preset-all` when you want the complete official demo capability matrix.
For example, PowerPoint preview is provided by `@file-viewer/renderer-presentation`, which routes binary `.ppt` to the native-WASM `@file-viewer/ppt@0.3.1` engine and PPTX/PPTM/POTX/POTM/PPSX/PPSM to the separate `@file-viewer/pptx` Worker engine. Neither engine enters the core-only install.

Style isolation is controlled by the shared `options.styleIsolation` field. Pure Web / IIFE / Web full entries default to Shadow DOM, while framework packages keep compatibility by default. Use `styleIsolation:'shadow'` when host global CSS is uncontrolled, and customize with `--file-viewer-*` tokens plus `::part()`. See [Style Isolation And Customization](/en/guide/style-isolation).

## Vite Auto Assembly

Use the Vite plugin when your app wants a complete developer experience without hand-writing every renderer import. The default setup auto-discovers installed presets; explicit `formats` and `scan:true` are only needed for strict custom cuts or source-hint driven assembly:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { fileViewerRenderers } from '@file-viewer/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    fileViewerRenderers({
      copyAssets: true,
      chunkStrategy: 'renderer'
    })
  ]
})
```

With `scan: true`, use `preset:'auto'` or `autoPresets:true` when installed presets should remain active while source hints add extra renderers. The scan reads hints such as `fileViewerFormats = ['pdf', 'docx']`, `data-file-viewer-formats="dwg,xmind"`, and upload `accept=".pdf,.xlsx"`.

## 2.1.0 Modular Import Paths

### Minimal import: install exactly the renderer you need

For a PDF-only product:

```bash
npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/renderer-pdf
```

```ts
import { pdfRenderer } from '@file-viewer/renderer-pdf'

const options = {
  rendererMode: 'replace',
  renderers: [pdfRenderer]
}
```

Replace `@file-viewer/vue3` with `@file-viewer/web`, `@file-viewer/react`, `@file-viewer/svelte`, `@file-viewer/jquery`, `@file-viewer/vue2.7`, or `@file-viewer/vue2.6` for other stacks. The `options` contract remains the same.

### Composed import: choose a product-shaped preset

For an Office document platform:

```bash
npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-office
```

```ts
import officePreset from '@file-viewer/preset-office'

const options = {
  rendererMode: 'replace',
  preset: officePreset
}
```

Use `preset-lite` for lightweight attachments, `preset-engineering` for CAD / 3D / Typst / EDA / data assets, and `preset-all` for the full sample matrix or all-format admin workbenches. Add `preset:'auto'` or `autoPresets:true` when you also enable `scan:true`, so installed presets and source hints work together. `copyAssets:true` copies Worker, WASM, PDF fonts, CAD, Typst WASM/fonts, Archive, and Data assets into your deployment directory so private intranet deployments do not depend on public CDNs.

## jQuery

Use `@file-viewer/jquery` when a traditional admin system or legacy page already standardizes on jQuery-style plugins:

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/jquery
```

The package exposes a native jQuery integration over the same core options, events, operation guards, search, zoom, print, export, and renderer presets. It does not embed Vue or React.

Use `@file-viewer/jquery-full` for the complete matrix without importing a preset. Vite still uses `copyAssets:true`; non-Vite jQuery builds run the Full package's included `npx --no-install file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer` command.

## Svelte

Use `@file-viewer/svelte` for Svelte applications:

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/svelte
```

The Svelte package keeps framework-native props and events while delegating renderer work to `@file-viewer/core` and the selected renderer packages.

Use `@file-viewer/svelte-full` for the complete matrix without importing a preset. SvelteKit/Vite uses `copyAssets:true`; other builds run the Full package's included `npx --no-install file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer` command.

## Core API

Use `@file-viewer/core` when building a custom host or a new ecosystem package:

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/core
```

Core is pure TypeScript and owns shared contracts, file source normalization, renderer registration, lifecycle events, operation availability, asset manifests, search/zoom/print/export protocols, and utility APIs. UI-specific behavior belongs in the component package for each framework.

## PPT and PPTX Engines

PowerPoint rendering is available through `@file-viewer/renderer-presentation`. Its lower-level engines keep binary and OpenXML formats separate:

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/ppt@0.3.1 @file-viewer/pptx
```

Use `@file-viewer/ppt` only for PowerPoint 97–2003 `.ppt`, and `@file-viewer/pptx` only for PPTX/OpenXML presentations. Most application teams should use the presentation renderer or `preset-office` instead of calling either engine directly.

## Compatibility Names

| Historical package | Prefer now |
| --- | --- |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-web` | `@file-viewer/web` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer3` | `@file-viewer/vue3` |
| `file-viewer3` | `@file-viewer/vue3` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer` | `@file-viewer/vue2.7` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-react` | `@file-viewer/react` |

Compatibility packages keep old projects working, but new projects get clearer package names, better npm discoverability, and a cleaner upgrade path with the standard names.
