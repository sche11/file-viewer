# Ecosystem Packages

<div class="doc-kicker">Native Package Lines</div>

<p class="doc-lead">
  New integrations should prefer the standard <code>@file-viewer/*</code> packages.
  Historical <code>@flyfish-group/*</code> names remain available for existing users.

## Renderer Packages

Heavy renderers are split so applications can install only what they need:

- `@file-viewer/renderer-pdf`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-word`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-ofd`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-presentation`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-cad`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-typst`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-archive`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-email`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-epub`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-text`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-image`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-media`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-mindmap`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-geo`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-drawing`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-3d`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-data`
- `@file-viewer/renderer-eda`

Standard component packages depend on the lightweight core foundation by default.
Install only the renderer packages your product needs, use `@file-viewer/preset-lite` / `@file-viewer/preset-office` / `@file-viewer/preset-engineering` for product-shaped bundles, or pass `@file-viewer/preset-all` when you want the complete official demo capability matrix.
For example, PowerPoint preview is provided by `@file-viewer/renderer-presentation`, which loads the native `@file-viewer/pptx` engine only when a PPTX/PPTM/POTX/POTM/PPSX/PPSM file is opened.

## Vite Auto Assembly

Use the Vite plugin when your app wants a complete developer experience without hand-writing every renderer import:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { fileViewerRenderers } from '@file-viewer/vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    fileViewerRenderers({
      formats: ['pdf', 'docx'],
      scan: true,
      copyAssets: true,
      chunkStrategy: 'renderer'
    })
  ]
})
```

With `scan: true`, the plugin inspects common source folders for hints such as `fileViewerFormats = ['pdf', 'docx']`, `data-file-viewer-formats="dwg,xmind"`, and upload `accept=".pdf,.xlsx"`. It then generates `virtual:file-viewer-renderers`, imports only the matching renderer packages, and keeps worker/WASM assets self-hostable.

## Compatibility Names

| Historical package | Prefer now |
| --- | --- |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-web` | `@file-viewer/web` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer3` | `@file-viewer/vue3` |
| `file-viewer3` | `@file-viewer/vue3` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer` | `@file-viewer/vue2.7` |
| `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-react` | `@file-viewer/react` |

Compatibility packages keep old projects working, but new projects get clearer package names, better npm discoverability, and a cleaner upgrade path with the standard names.
