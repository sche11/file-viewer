# Distribution

<div class="doc-kicker">npm, GitHub, Releases, Self-hosting</div>

<p class="doc-lead">
  Flyfish Viewer is distributed through standard npm packages, public GitHub repositories, release downloads, and self-hostable worker/WASM assets.
</p>

## npm Registry

Common installs:

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-office
# Heavy users / all-format attachment centers:
npm install @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-all
# Replace @file-viewer/vue3 with @file-viewer/web / react / vue2.7 / vue2.6 / jquery / svelte for other stacks.
```

Pass the preset through `options.preset` in Webpack, Rspack, Rollup, Umi, classic multi-page apps, or internal component libraries. Vite projects can additionally install and register the plugin:

```bash
npm install -D @file-viewer/vite-plugin
```

Recommended Vite setup:

```ts
fileViewerRenderers({
  copyAssets: true
})
```

After registration, the plugin auto-discovers installed `@file-viewer/preset-*` packages and injects the capability layer. Use single renderer packages plus `formats` only for strict custom cuts.

Common customization boundaries:

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `copyAssets:true` | Copies matched Worker, WASM, font, PDF/CAD/Typst/Archive/Data, and other static assets; recommended for production and intranet deployments |
| `formats` / `renderers` | Generates exact renderer imports when you do not use a preset, or when a preset needs a few extra formats |
| `scan:true` | Reads source hints such as `fileViewerFormats`, `data-file-viewer-formats`, and upload `accept` attributes |
| `preset:'auto'` / `autoPresets:true` | Keeps installed preset auto-activation enabled while `scan:true` is active |
| `inject:false` | Disables auto injection so application code can import `virtual:file-viewer-renderers` and pass `options.renderers` manually |

The package metadata points to the public repositories, documentation, issue trackers, Apache-2.0 license, and sponsorship URL.
`@file-viewer/core` stays lightweight and does not install Word or native PPTX engines directly.
Use `@file-viewer/preset-lite`, `@file-viewer/preset-office`, or `@file-viewer/preset-engineering` for product-shaped bundles; use individual renderer packages for the smallest custom install, or `@file-viewer/preset-all` when you want the same full renderer matrix as the official demo.
`@file-viewer/pptx` is the standalone engine package for custom renderer work.

## GitHub

Main repository:

- [github.com/flyfish-dev/file-viewer](https://github.com/flyfish-dev/file-viewer)

Suggested discovery topics for the main repository:

```txt
file-viewer, document-viewer, document-preview, file-preview, office-viewer,
pdf-viewer, docx, pptx, xlsx, cad-viewer, drawio, excalidraw, web-component,
vue, react, svelte, typescript, wasm, offline-first, self-hosted
```

When you are ready to update the repository topics:

```bash
gh repo edit flyfish-dev/file-viewer \
  --remove-topic cad \
  --remove-topic office \
  --remove-topic jquery \
  --remove-topic ofd \
  --add-topic document-preview \
  --add-topic file-preview \
  --add-topic web-component \
  --add-topic self-hosted
```

GitHub currently allows up to 20 repository topics, so treat this list as the main SEO surface.

## Release Downloads

GitHub Releases can carry:

- static demo builds
- docs builds
- npm tarballs for offline installs
- component demo builds
- source bundles
- demo GIF or MP4 assets for posts and README embeds

For offline or intranet package installs, download the tarballs and install them through a private registry or direct local paths.

## Self-hosted Runtime Assets

Copy browser runtime assets into your app:

```bash
npx file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer
```

This copies and verifies worker, WASM, PDF, CAD, Typst WASM/fonts, SQLite, archive, Office, Draw.io, and other renderer assets. Runtime options can point each renderer to those self-hosted URLs.

For Cloudflare Pages, edge compression is enabled according to the visitor `Accept-Encoding` header. `scripts/deploy-cloudflare-pages.mjs` also Brotli-compresses oversized WASM files before Direct Upload and writes `Content-Encoding: br`, `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, `Content-Type: application/wasm`, and long-term cache headers into `_headers`. This keeps large assets such as the Typst compiler WASM deployable under the original `.wasm` URL. After deployment, verify the live headers with:

```bash
pnpm verify:cloudflare-compression
```

## Sponsorship

Flyfish Viewer remains Apache-2.0 open source. Sponsorship helps fund compatibility work, private deployment support, and priority issue handling:
