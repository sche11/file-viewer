## Four-step Integration

| Step | Decision | Fast answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Pick the component package | Use standard packages such as `@file-viewer/web`, `@file-viewer/vue3`, or `@file-viewer/react` for the lightest entry; use full packages such as `@file-viewer/web-full`, `@file-viewer/vue3-full`, or `@file-viewer/react-full` for one-step complete capability. |
| 2 | Pick the capability layer | Standard packages receive `preset-lite`, `preset-office`, `preset-engineering`, or `preset-all` through options; full packages enable the complete matrix by default. |
| 3 | Pass the source and options | Use `url="/files/demo.pdf"` or a real `File`; standard packages pass a preset through `options`, while full packages can start with theme, toolbar, watermark, and business options only. |
| 4 | Confirm style isolation | Prefer the Web Component / full default Shadow DOM when host CSS is uncontrolled; framework packages can pass `options.styleIsolation:'shadow'`. |

This page keeps the shortest runnable paths. See [Component Options](/en/guide/usage) for the full API, renderer package matrix, toolbar, watermark, print, search, lifecycle, and guard options. See [Style Isolation And Customization](/en/guide/style-isolation) for Shadow DOM, tokens, and parts. See [Modular Assembly](/en/guide/on-demand-renderers) for on-demand renderers and the Vite plugin.

<div class="doc-callout">
  <strong>Mobile note:</strong> for H5 and mobile browsers, give the viewer host a stable height such as <code>height:100dvh; min-height:0</code>, and prefer <code>toolbar.position:'bottom-right'</code>. React Native should load a WebView-based H5 viewer route; the DOM component cannot mount directly into native RN views. See the <a href="/en/guide/quickstart-react#mobile-h5-and-react-native-webview">React mobile example</a>.
</div>

## Pick The Capability Layer First

Installing a standard component package such as `@file-viewer/vue3`, `@file-viewer/react`, or `@file-viewer/web` is the lightest path. It gives you the native framework component, types, controller APIs, and the core foundation; it does not install every heavy PDF, Office, CAD, Typst, archive, or engineering renderer by default.

If you want to validate the complete official demo capability first, use a full package. Full packages import `@file-viewer/preset-all` for you, keep the same component API, and enable the full format matrix by default. For CDN / script-tag pages, prefer `@file-viewer/web-full`: jsDelivr / unpkg distribute the complete IIFE directly from npm, so the host application does not need to carry the full dependency set; the script also resolves bundled workers, WASM files, fonts, and vendor assets relative to its own URL. For intranet, strict-CSP, or fully offline deployments, mirror those assets to your own static domain.

| Mode | Install | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light standard package | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-office` | Pick exactly the preset / renderer your product needs |
| Complete full package | `npm i @file-viewer/vue3-full` | Enables `preset-all` by default for all-format workbenches |
| CDN full | `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@file-viewer/web-full@latest/dist/flyfish-file-viewer-web-full.iife.js` | No local install, ideal for script-tag validation |

Add a preset or a single renderer package for the file formats your product actually needs:

| Package | Coverage | Best fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@file-viewer/preset-lite` | Text, Markdown, code, image, audio, video | Lightweight attachment preview |
| `@file-viewer/preset-office` | PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OFD, RTF, OpenDocument | OA, approvals, knowledge bases, contracts |
| `@file-viewer/preset-engineering` | CAD, 3D, drawing, XMind, Geo, Typst, Archive, Data, EDA | Engineering, R&D, design assets |
| `@file-viewer/preset-all` | Full official demo matrix | Demos and internal all-format workbenches |
| Single renderer | For example `@file-viewer/renderer-pdf` or `@file-viewer/renderer-word` | Minimal custom format cuts |

The most stable integration path is to import a preset or renderer explicitly and pass it through `options.preset` / `options.renderers`. This works in Webpack, Rspack, Rollup, Umi, classic multi-page apps, micro-frontends, and internal component libraries. Vite projects can add `@file-viewer/vite-plugin` later to remove manual imports and copy offline assets automatically.

### Universal Setup: Inject options.preset

Install the component package and one preset:

```bash
pnpm add @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-office
```

```ts
import officePreset from '@file-viewer/preset-office'

export const viewerOptions = {
  preset: officePreset,
  rendererMode: 'replace',
  theme: 'light',
  toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' }
}
```

Pass the same options object to your framework component:

```vue
<file-viewer url="/files/demo.docx" :options="viewerOptions" />
```

Multiple capability bundles use the same `preset` field as an array, so applications do not need a second option name:

```ts
import officePreset from '@file-viewer/preset-office'
import engineeringPreset from '@file-viewer/preset-engineering'

export const viewerOptions = {
  preset: [officePreset, engineeringPreset],
  rendererMode: 'replace'
}
```

For the smallest exact cut, skip presets and install a single renderer:

```bash
pnpm add @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/renderer-pdf
```

```ts
import { pdfRenderer } from '@file-viewer/renderer-pdf'

export const viewerOptions = {
  renderers: [pdfRenderer],
  rendererMode: 'replace'
}
```

If a file extension is supported but the required renderer is not assembled, the viewer shows an install-oriented hint instead of a vague unsupported state.

### One-Step Setup: Full Packages

Full packages are for teams that want the complete format experience first and can optimize package size later. They expose the same props, events, controller APIs, and options as standard packages, but `preset-all` is enabled by default:

| Ecosystem | Full package | Standard package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vanilla JS / Web Component | `@file-viewer/web-full` | `@file-viewer/web` |
| Vue 3 | `@file-viewer/vue3-full` | `@file-viewer/vue3` |
| Vue 2.7 | `@file-viewer/vue2.7-full` | `@file-viewer/vue2.7` |
| Vue 2.6 | `@file-viewer/vue2.6-full` | `@file-viewer/vue2.6` |
| React 18 / 19 | `@file-viewer/react-full` | `@file-viewer/react` |
| React 16.8 / 17 | `@file-viewer/react-legacy-full` | `@file-viewer/react-legacy` |
| jQuery | `@file-viewer/jquery-full` | `@file-viewer/jquery` |
| Svelte | `@file-viewer/svelte-full` | `@file-viewer/svelte` |

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/vue3-full
```

```ts
import FileViewer from '@file-viewer/vue3-full'
```

```vue
<file-viewer url="/files/contract.pdf" :options="{ theme: 'light', toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' } }" />
```

React, Vue 2, Svelte, and jQuery keep the same component shape; only the package name changes.

### CDN Full: Complete Script-Tag Trial

No-build pages can load the full CDN bundle directly. It avoids local package installation and is useful for demos, POCs, and classic admin pages:

```html
<div id="viewer" style="height:720px"></div>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@file-viewer/web-full@latest/dist/flyfish-file-viewer-web-full.iife.js"></script>
<script>
  FlyfishFileViewerWebFull.mountViewer(document.getElementById('viewer'), {
    url: '/files/demo.pdf',
    options: {
      theme: 'light',
      toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' }
    }
  })
</script>
```

The Custom Element route is available as well:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@file-viewer/web-full@latest/dist/flyfish-file-viewer-web-full.iife.js"></script>
<flyfish-file-viewer
  src="/files/demo.docx"
  theme="light"
  toolbar-position="bottom-right"
  style="display:block;height:720px"
></flyfish-file-viewer>
```

### Vite Plugin: Zero-Config Assembly

In Vite projects, install and register the plugin in addition to a preset. Once `fileViewerRenderers({ copyAssets:true })` is in `vite.config.ts`, it auto-discovers installed `@file-viewer/preset-*` packages, injects the renderer virtual module, and copies Worker / WASM / font / vendor assets. Application code no longer needs to import the preset manually:

```bash
pnpm add @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-office
pnpm add -D @file-viewer/vite-plugin
```

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { fileViewerRenderers } from '@file-viewer/vite-plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    fileViewerRenderers({
      copyAssets: true
      // No preset:'office' needed; the plugin discovers installed @file-viewer/preset-office.
    })
  ]
}
```

Heavy users can switch to the complete preset while keeping the same Vite config:

```bash
pnpm add @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-all
pnpm add -D @file-viewer/vite-plugin
```

Use explicit options only when you need customization:

| Option | Best fit |
| --- | --- |
| `copyAssets:true` | Copies Worker, WASM, PDF font, CAD, Typst, Archive, Data, and other offline assets; recommended for production and intranet deployments |
| `formats` / `renderers` | Generates exact renderer imports when you do not use a preset, or when a preset needs a few extra formats |
| `scan:true` | Scans source hints such as `fileViewerFormats`, `data-file-viewer-formats`, and upload `accept` attributes |
| `preset:'auto'` / `autoPresets:true` | Keeps installed preset auto-discovery active while `scan:true` is enabled |
| `inject:false` | Disables auto injection so you can import `virtual:file-viewer-renderers` and pass `options.renderers` manually |
| `chunkStrategy:'renderer'` | Splits chunks by renderer for caching, debugging, and heavy-pipeline size analysis |

The recommended default is `fileViewerRenderers({ copyAssets:true })`. Configure the advanced options only for strict bundle cuts, source-hint scanning, or complete registry control.

## Vanilla JavaScript / Web Component

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/web @file-viewer/preset-office
```

```html
<flyfish-file-viewer
  id="viewer"
  src="/files/demo.pdf"
  filename="demo.pdf"
  locale="en-US"
  theme="light"
  toolbar-position="bottom-right"
  style="display:block;height:720px"
></flyfish-file-viewer>
```

```ts
import { defineFileViewerElement } from '@file-viewer/web'
import officePreset from '@file-viewer/preset-office'

defineFileViewerElement()

const viewer = document.getElementById('viewer')
viewer.options = {
  preset: officePreset,
  rendererMode: 'replace',
  theme: 'light',
  toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' }
}
```

## Vue 3

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/preset-office
```

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import FileViewer from '@file-viewer/vue3'

createApp(App).use(FileViewer).mount('#app')
```

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import officePreset from '@file-viewer/preset-office'

const viewerOptions = {
  preset: officePreset,
  rendererMode: 'replace',
  theme: 'light',
  toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' }
}
</script>

<template>
  <div style="height: 100vh">
    <file-viewer url="/files/report.docx" :options="viewerOptions" />
  </div>
</template>
```

## React

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/react @file-viewer/preset-office
```

```tsx
import FileViewer from '@file-viewer/react'
import officePreset from '@file-viewer/preset-office'

export function Preview() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100vh' }}>
      <FileViewer
        url="/files/report.pdf"
        options={{
          preset: officePreset,
          rendererMode: 'replace',
          theme: 'light',
          toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' },
          archive: { cache: true }
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

React 16.8/17 projects can use `@file-viewer/react-legacy`.

## Locale And Copy

The viewer defaults to `locale: 'auto'`, which follows the browser language and resolves to Chinese or English. Use the same `options` object across Vanilla JS / Pure Web, Vue, React, jQuery, and Svelte when you need a fixed locale or custom copy:

```ts
const options = {
  locale: 'en-US',
  messages: {
    'toolbar.download': 'Save file'
  }
}
```

You can also group locale and copy under `i18n`:

```ts
const options = {
  i18n: {
    locale: 'zh-CN',
    messages(key, params, locale) {
      return key === 'state.empty.title' ? '请选择文件' : undefined
    }
  }
}
```

Web Component users can set `locale="en-US"` directly on `<flyfish-file-viewer>`.

You can read the complete `FileViewerMessageKey` mapping from core. The exported object is the same copy source used at runtime, so it is the safest way to generate translation sheets, coverage checks, or custom-copy tests for the installed version:

```ts
import {
  FILE_VIEWER_BUILTIN_MESSAGES,
  type FileViewerMessageKey
} from '@file-viewer/core'

const rows: Array<{
  key: FileViewerMessageKey
  zhCN: string
  enUS: string
}> = Object.keys(FILE_VIEWER_BUILTIN_MESSAGES['zh-CN']).map(key => ({
  key: key as FileViewerMessageKey,
  zhCN: FILE_VIEWER_BUILTIN_MESSAGES['zh-CN'][key as FileViewerMessageKey],
  enUS: FILE_VIEWER_BUILTIN_MESSAGES['en-US'][key as FileViewerMessageKey]
}))
```

`messages` only needs the keys you want to override. Missing keys continue to use the built-in copy for the active `locale`. Loading states, error states, toolbar controls, PDF / Office / OFD / archive surfaces, and standard renderer notices all follow the same `options.locale` / `options.i18n` path.

## Authenticated Files

If your app must authenticate before downloading a file, fetch the file in the host app and pass a named `File` to the viewer:

```ts
const blob = await fetch('/api/files/contract', {
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(response => response.blob())

const file = new File([blob], 'contract.pdf', { type: blob.type })
```

Passing a filename with an extension is important because the viewer uses it to pick the renderer.

## Self-host Worker And WASM Assets

Most web apps can install the package and run. For intranet, strict CSP, offline, or custom static-prefix deployments, copy viewer assets into your app:

```bash
npx file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer
```

The copy command verifies PDF, archive, DOCX, spreadsheet, Draw.io, CAD, Typst, SQLite, Worker, WASM, and vendor assets. Runtime options let you point each renderer to your own static paths.

## Try The Demo Locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The main demo opens at the Vite dev server URL. The comparison demo is available at `/compare.html`.
