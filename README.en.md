# Flyfish Viewer

[Simplified Chinese](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

Bring Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Typst, XMind mind maps, archives, email, audio/video, ebooks, drawings, CAD, geospatial data, 3D models, Markdown, images, fonts, design assets, structured data, and source code preview into the browser with a clean, deployable viewer.

`@file-viewer/core` provides the low-level preview capabilities, format matrix, lifecycle events, and operation APIs. Independent renderer packages such as `@file-viewer/pptx` own heavy format engines that can evolve separately. Vanilla JavaScript / Pure Web, Vue 3, Vue 2.7, Vue 2.6, React, React Legacy, jQuery, and Svelte standard component packages provide native component experiences, type exports, and ecosystem-specific interaction layers on top of the same foundation. New integrations should prefer the standard `@file-viewer/*` package names; historical `@flyfish-group/*` package names remain synchronized.

The viewer does not require a backend conversion service. It is designed for OA systems, knowledge bases, attachment centers, workflow platforms, customer support portals, document approval flows, intranet systems, and offline-capable deployments where file preview should feel like a maintained product module rather than a temporary feature.

The integration promise is simple: **one component, one line of code, fast integration**. Pick the standard package for your stack, then use the same options, events, search, zoom, print, export, and watermark capabilities everywhere.

- Standard npm packages: `@file-viewer/core`, `@file-viewer/pptx`, `@file-viewer/renderer-word`, `@file-viewer/renderer-presentation`, `@file-viewer/renderer-drawing`, `@file-viewer/renderer-3d`, `@file-viewer/renderer-data`, `@file-viewer/renderer-eda`, `@file-viewer/preset-lite`, `@file-viewer/preset-office`, `@file-viewer/preset-engineering`, `@file-viewer/preset-all`, `@file-viewer/vite-plugin`, `@file-viewer/web`, `@file-viewer/vue3`, `@file-viewer/vue2.7`, `@file-viewer/vue2.6`, `@file-viewer/react`, `@file-viewer/react-legacy`, `@file-viewer/jquery`, `@file-viewer/svelte`
- Historical compatibility packages: `@flyfish-group/file-viewer3`, `file-viewer3`, `@flyfish-group/file-viewer`, `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-react`, `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-web`

## Why Use It

- **Pure frontend and serverless.** File parsing and rendering happen in the browser. You do not need Office Server, a LibreOffice daemon, or a document conversion backend.
- **Broad format coverage.** The current release maps 206 extensions across 24 preview pipelines, including Office, PDF, OFD, Typst, XMind mind maps, archives, email, EDA files, CAD, geospatial data, 3D models, Excalidraw, draw.io, Mermaid, PlantUML, EPUB, UMD, Markdown, images, audio/video, source code, Git patch/bundle, fonts, PSD layer assets, and structured data.
- **Lazy loaded renderers.** Heavy PDF, Office, OFD, Typst, XMind, archive, email, CAD, geospatial, 3D, ebook, Markdown, HLS, HEIC, data-asset, and code highlighting dependencies are loaded only when the file type needs them.
- **Production-ready operations.** The viewer includes original file download, full rendered printing, rendered HTML export, watermark options, theme options, lifecycle hooks, native event callbacks, and before-operation guards for permission checks.
- **Better document reading.** Word and PDF keep a grey workspace, white paper surface, centered reading, width fitting, navigation, zoom, rotation, and complete print / HTML export paths.
- **Renderer-native zoom controls.** The common toolbar can zoom in, zoom out, and reset through per-format providers for PDF, Word, PPTX, virtual Excel tables, images, CAD, OFD, Typst, Markdown, code, and drawing files, avoiding fragile host-level CSS transforms.
- **Controlled theming.** `options.theme` supports `light`, `dark`, and `system`. Light business UIs can lock the viewer to `light` even when the operating system is in dark mode.
- **PDF toolbar ergonomics.** `toolbar.position` supports `auto`, `top`, and `bottom-right`. In `auto` mode, PDF uses a bottom-right floating operation bar to avoid duplicating the PDF navigation toolbar.
- **Demo and comparison views.** The repository includes the main demo and a standalone `/compare.html` page for side-by-side document comparison.
- **Consistent native component package experience.** Core focuses on preview capabilities while Vanilla JavaScript / Pure Web, Vue 3, Vue 2, React, jQuery, and Svelte standard component packages expose the same option, event, search, zoom, print, and export semantics in each ecosystem.
- **Open-source main distribution.** The open-source main repository contains core, standalone renderer packages, standard component packages, compatibility packages, the runnable main demo source, documentation source, minified build artifacts, sample files, Docker deployment assets, npm tarballs, and release downloads. The private Gitea aggregate remains valuable for the complete workspace, unified release automation, sponsorship, and priority support.

## Supported Formats

The viewer is organized around preview pipelines rather than one-off file extensions.

## Current npm Ecosystem

The current version follows the npm registry `latest` dist-tag. The ecosystem publishes 38 npm targets: 33 standard component / core / renderer / preset / tooling packages and 5 historical aliases. New integrations should prefer the `@file-viewer/*` standard package names; existing applications using `@flyfish-group/*` or `file-viewer3` continue to receive the same versioned capability set.

The boundary is intentional: `@file-viewer/core` owns low-level preview capability and APIs; every standard component package depends only on core plus its own ecosystem dependencies; historical aliases keep old package names working and are not the recommended first choice for new projects.

Common installs:

```bash
pnpm add @file-viewer/web
pnpm add @file-viewer/vue3
pnpm add @file-viewer/react
pnpm add @file-viewer/core
pnpm add @file-viewer/renderer-word
pnpm add @file-viewer/pptx
```

For intranet or offline environments, the open-source main repository also ships release tarballs under `artifacts/`:

```bash
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-core-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-pptx-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-renderer-word-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-web-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-vue3-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-vue2.7-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-vue2.6-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-react-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-react-legacy-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-jquery-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/file-viewer-svelte-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/flyfish-group-file-viewer3-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/flyfish-group-file-viewer-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/flyfish-group-file-viewer-web-*.tgz
npm install ./artifacts/flyfish-group-file-viewer-react-*.tgz
```

The open-source main repository ships tarballs for core, the native PPTX engine, Vanilla JavaScript / Pure Web, Vue 3, Vue 2, React, React legacy, jQuery, Svelte, and historical compatibility packages. The unscoped `file-viewer3` compatibility package is still published to npm, but its package body duplicates `@flyfish-group/file-viewer3`, so the repository does not store a second copy. Vanilla JavaScript and React packages are native component packages; use npm installation for the cleanest dependency resolution.

If you use pnpm 10 and see `Ignored build scripts: @flyfish-group/file-viewer-web`, run:

```bash
pnpm approve-builds
```

Then allow `@flyfish-group/file-viewer-web`, or manually copy the bundled viewer assets:

```bash
pnpm exec file-viewer-copy-assets ./public/file-viewer
```

The unscoped `file-viewer3` historical alias remains part of the npm release flow. The open-source main repository uses `flyfish-group-file-viewer3-*.tgz` as the Vue 3 compatibility tarball to avoid storing duplicate package bodies.

## Standard Ecosystem Packages and Public Repositories

This section is generated from `ecosystem/wrappers.json` and `packages/core/src/registry/formats.ts`. The open-source main repository carries the same index so users can find standard npm packages, historical compatibility packages, split component repositories, and release downloads from one place.

Core foundation package: `@file-viewer/core`. Core source is public: https://github.com/flyfish-dev/file-viewer-core and https://gitee.com/flyfish-dev/file-viewer-core. The open-source aggregate repository provides runnable main demo source, core, standard component packages, compatibility aliases, documentation source, build artifacts, examples, and release tarballs; private Gitea `main` is the complete original aggregate workspace for unified automation, integration history, sponsorship, and priority support, and is not the same as the GitHub open-source aggregate.

## Engineering-Grade On-Demand Renderer Assembly

One component, one line of code, fast integration; renderer assembly is what controls install size and first-screen bundle weight. Prefer a product-shaped preset first: `@file-viewer/preset-lite`, `@file-viewer/preset-office`, `@file-viewer/preset-engineering`, or `@file-viewer/preset-all`. Install individual renderer packages only when you need the smallest possible custom cut. The Vite plugin generates `virtual:file-viewer-renderers`, and application code passes the same shared `options` everywhere.

```bash
npm i @file-viewer/vue3 @file-viewer/core @file-viewer/vite-plugin @file-viewer/preset-office
```

```ts
import { fileViewerRenderers } from '@file-viewer/vite-plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    fileViewerRenderers({
      preset: 'office',
      scan: true,
      copyAssets: true
    })
  ]
}
```

```ts
import { configuredFileViewerRenderers } from 'virtual:file-viewer-renderers'

const options = {
  builtinRenderers: 'none',
  renderers: configuredFileViewerRenderers,
  rendererMode: 'replace'
}
```

- Vue, React, Svelte, jQuery, and Vanilla JavaScript / Pure Web all receive the same `options`; each package maps them to native props, hooks, actions, plugins, or `mountViewer(...)` parameters.
- `preset-lite` covers text, Markdown, code, images, audio, and video; `preset-office` covers PDF / Word / Excel / PowerPoint / OFD; `preset-engineering` covers CAD / 3D / drawing / XMind / Geo / Typst / EDA / Data.
- For the smallest custom bundle, skip presets, install individual renderers such as `@file-viewer/renderer-pdf` or `@file-viewer/renderer-word`, and let `formats` generate exact imports.
- `scan:true` detects `fileViewerFormats`, `data-file-viewer-formats`, and upload `accept` hints so development and production builds select matching renderers automatically.
- `copyAssets:true` copies PDF/CAD/Typst/Archive/Data workers, WASM, and vendor assets for offline and enterprise intranet deployment.
- If you want the complete official demo capability matrix, install `@file-viewer/preset-all` and pass `allRenderers` to `renderers`; this is ideal for demos and internal admin tools, but should not be every product default.

### Component Props and Toolbar Customization Summary

Every ecosystem package exposes a native integration surface. Vanilla JavaScript / Pure Web is the first stop for framework-free pages, Custom Elements, and script tags; Vue 3 keeps a compact declarative prop API; React, Svelte, jQuery, and Vue 2 are better when you need imperative mount fields such as `buffer`, `name`, `type`, and `size`. See the full examples in the official documentation: https://doc.file-viewer.app/guide/ecosystem

| Component | Actual props / entry | Event channel | Customization entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vanilla JS / Pure Web `@file-viewer/web` | `<flyfish-file-viewer>` attributes: `src/url`, `filename/name`, `type`, `size`, `theme`, `toolbar`, `toolbar-position`, `watermark`, `search`, `options`; also supports `mountViewer(...)` | `viewer-ready`, `viewer-event`, `viewer-state-change`, `viewer-error`, `onEvent`, `onStateChange`, `controller.subscribe()` | The Custom Element instance exposes the full controller handle; the IIFE script auto-registers it while keeping imperative `mountViewer` and the asset copy CLI. |
| Vue 3 `@file-viewer/vue3` | `url`, `file`, `options` | `load-start`, `load-complete`, `unload-start`, `unload-complete`, `operation-before`, `operation-cancel`, `operation-availability-change`, `search-change`, `location-change`, `zoom-change` | Template refs expose `FileViewerExpose`. For `Blob` / `ArrayBuffer`, prefer wrapping it as a named `File` so extension detection stays deterministic. |
| Vue 2.7 `@file-viewer/vue2.7` | `url`, `file`, `buffer`, `name`, `filename`, `type`, `size`, `options`, `containerClass`, `containerStyle` | `viewer-event` / `viewerEvent` | The component instance exposes the full controller handle. This is the Vue 2.7 line behind the historical `@flyfish-group/file-viewer` package. |
| Vue 2.6 `@file-viewer/vue2.6` | Same as Vue 2.7 | `viewer-event` / `viewerEvent` | Separate Vue 2.6 build for long-lived applications that cannot move to Vue 2.7. |
| React `@file-viewer/react` | `ViewerMountOptions` plus native `div` props such as `className`, `style`, `data-*`, and `aria-*` | `onEvent`, `onStateChange` | `ref` exposes `FileViewerHandle`; `useFileViewer()` returns `ref`, `props`, `state`, and `handle` for custom toolbars. |
| React Legacy `@file-viewer/react-legacy` | Same as the React package | `onEvent`, `onStateChange` | Targets React 16.8 / 17 with a legacy-friendly component export. |
| jQuery `@file-viewer/jquery` | `$(el).fileViewer(ViewerMountOptions & { replace?: boolean })` | `onEvent`, `onStateChange`, or `getFileViewerController(el).subscribe()` | Plugin methods include `zoomIn`, `printRenderedHtml`, and `searchDocument`; `replace:false` updates the same node in place. |
| Svelte `@file-viewer/svelte` | `ViewerMountOptions` plus `className` and `containerStyle` | `on:viewerEvent`, `onEvent`, `onStateChange` | `bind:this` exposes the controller handle; the `use:fileViewer` action is also available and adds `replace`. |

The built-in toolbar can be used as-is, or hidden with `toolbar:false` so your own UI can call the same ref, hook, controller, action, or jQuery plugin APIs.

| Toolbar config | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `toolbar: false` | Hides the built-in toolbar without disabling controller APIs such as download, print, export, and zoom. Use this for a fully custom business toolbar. |
| `toolbar: true` | Uses the default built-in toolbar. Download, print, HTML export, and zoom buttons are still shown only when the active renderer supports them. |
| `download` / `print` / `exportHtml` / `zoom` | Expresses whether the host allows a button. Final availability is still computed from file type, render readiness, export adapter, and zoom provider state. |
| `position` | `auto`, `top`, or `bottom-right`. The default `auto` floats PDF actions at bottom right to avoid conflicting with the PDF page / outline toolbar. |
| `beforeOperation` | Toolbar-level preflight that runs after `options.beforeOperation`. Returning `false` or throwing cancels the operation. |
| `beforeDownload` / `beforePrint` / `beforeExportHtml` | Operation-specific preflight for download permission, print audit, export confirmation, and similar business rules. |

The shared format matrix currently declares 24 preview pipelines and 206 file extensions. Full capability is assembled through renderer packages or presets. See the full format guide in this README and the official documentation: https://doc.file-viewer.app/guide/formats

The commercial edition comes from the Flyfish Office product line. It provides a self-developed native Office document engine for serious enterprise Word, Excel, and PowerPoint scenarios, with stronger fidelity for complex layout, large files, pagination, high-quality rendering, and stable performance. The open-source edition will continue to evolve; commercial support is mainly for faster maintainer response, private deployment evaluation, and custom delivery.

## Vanilla JavaScript Integration

One component, one line of code, fast integration. Whether you use Vanilla JavaScript, Vue, React, jQuery, or Svelte, start from the standard component package for your ecosystem so the preview capability stays consistent while the host integration remains native.

Use this path for framework-free pages, micro-frontend shells, classic admin systems, low-code platforms, and any product that wants a native Custom Element or imperative controller without Vue, React, or jQuery.

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/web
```

```html
<flyfish-file-viewer
  src="/files/demo.pdf"
  theme="light"
  toolbar-position="bottom-right"
  style="display:block;height:100vh"
></flyfish-file-viewer>

<script type="module">
  import { defineFileViewerElement } from '@file-viewer/web'

  defineFileViewerElement()
</script>
```

`@file-viewer/web` also provides `mountViewer(container, options)`, the script-tag IIFE build, and `file-viewer-copy-assets` for offline worker/WASM asset deployment.

## Vue 3 Integration

```bash
npm install @flyfish-group/file-viewer3
```

```ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import FileViewer from '@flyfish-group/file-viewer3'

createApp(App).use(FileViewer).mount('#app')
```

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'

const url = ref('/files/demo.pdf')

const options = {
  theme: 'light',
  toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right', download: true, print: true, exportHtml: true },
  watermark: { text: 'Internal Preview', opacity: 0.14 },
  pdf: { streaming: 'same-origin', rangeChunkSize: 64 * 1024 }
}
</script>

<template>
  <div style="height: 100vh">
    <file-viewer :url="url" :options="options" />
  </div>
</template>
```

For local files or authenticated downloads, pass a `File` object:

```ts
const response = await fetch('/api/files/contract', { credentials: 'include' })
const blob = await response.blob()

file.value = new File([blob], 'contract.pdf', { type: blob.type })
```

The filename matters. The viewer uses the extension to choose the correct rendering pipeline.

## Vue 2.7 Integration

```bash
npm install @flyfish-group/file-viewer
```

```ts
import Vue from 'vue'
import FileViewer from '@flyfish-group/file-viewer'

Vue.use(FileViewer)
```

```vue
<template>
  <div style="height: 100vh">
    <file-viewer :url="url" :options="options" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      url: '/files/demo.pdf',
      options: {
        theme: 'light',
        toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' }
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

The Vue 2 and Vue 3 package lines share the same user-facing capabilities and option semantics.

## React Integration

The React package is a native component package. It renders a React container and mounts the complete viewer through its local controller on top of `@file-viewer/core` and the core browser engine.

```bash
npm install @file-viewer/react
```

```tsx
import FileViewer from '@file-viewer/react'

export function Preview() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100vh' }}>
      <FileViewer
        url="/files/demo.pdf"
        options={{
          theme: 'light',
          toolbar: { position: 'bottom-right' },
          watermark: { text: 'Internal Preview', opacity: 0.14 }
        }}
        onEvent={(event) => {
          console.log(event.type, event.payload)
        }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Historical package names remain compatible, but new projects should prefer the standard `@file-viewer/*` packages.

## Core Options

| Option                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`                        | `light`, `dark`, or `system`. Default is `system`. Use `light` when embedding in a fixed light UI.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `builtinRenderers`             | Core built-in renderer set: `all`, `lite`, or `none`. Use `lite` for the low-cost image path only; use `none` when renderer packages or presets should be the only installed rendering surface. Use `@file-viewer/preset-lite` for lightweight attachments, `@file-viewer/preset-office` for office documents, `@file-viewer/preset-engineering` for engineering attachments, and `@file-viewer/preset-all` for the complete demo matrix. UMD and EPUB ebooks are provided on demand by `@file-viewer/renderer-epub`. |
| `renderers` / `rendererMode`   | Installs renderer packages or presets into the viewer. `replace` starts from an empty registry; `extend` appends to the current built-in set. New projects can combine `builtinRenderers: 'none'` or `lite` with explicit renderers to keep installs and bundles small.   |
| `toolbar`                      | `true`, `false`, or an object that controls download, print, HTML export, unified zoom controls, and toolbar position.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `toolbar.zoom`                 | Shows or hides the built-in zoom group. The actual capability is provided by each renderer, so unsupported or interaction-sensitive formats are not force-scaled.                                                                                                         |
| `toolbar.position`             | `auto`, `top`, or `bottom-right`. Default `auto` floats the operation bar at bottom right for PDF and keeps other formats at top.                                                                                                                                         |
| `watermark`                    | Text or image watermark configuration. Watermark participates in preview, print, and exported HTML.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `archive.workerUrl`            | Custom `libarchive.js` Worker URL for special private deployments. By default the viewer tries `vendor/libarchive/worker-bundle.js` under the current base and then falls back to ZIP/TAR/GZIP compatibility mode when possible.                                          |
| `archive.wasmUrl`              | Custom libarchive WASM URL used when the static Worker needs to load WASM from a non-adjacent path.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `archive.workerTimeoutMs`      | Worker initialization, encryption check, and directory-read timeout. Defaults to 30000ms and then falls back to ZIP/TAR/GZIP compatibility mode when possible.                                                                                                            |
| `archive.cache`                | Enables IndexedDB cache for extracted archive entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `archive.maxArchiveSize`       | Maximum archive size allowed for directory parsing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `archive.maxEntryPreviewSize`  | Maximum extracted entry size allowed for online preview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `docx.worker`                  | Controls the `@file-viewer/docx` Worker used inside `@file-viewer/renderer-word`. Defaults to `true`; set it to `false` only when Workers are blocked by CSP or the host runtime.                                                                                       |
| `docx.workerUrl`               | Custom DOCX Worker URL. The default candidate is `vendor/docx/docx.worker.js` under the current deployment base.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `docx.workerJsZipUrl`          | Custom JSZip URL loaded by the DOCX Worker. The default candidate is `vendor/docx/jszip.min.js` under the current deployment base.                                                                                                                                        |
| `docx.progressive`             | Controls async page-batch rendering. Defaults to progressive batches for large-document readability.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `docx.visualPagination`        | Opt-in visual pagination for DOCX. The default is continuous flow reading for better stability with complex TOCs, tables, and long Chinese documents.                                                                                                                     |
| `docx.workerTimeout`           | DOCX Worker timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 120000ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `spreadsheet.worker`           | Enables the optional spreadsheet Worker path. Defaults to `false`; main-thread parsing avoids local-server, mobile WebView, MIME, or CSP Worker stalls.                                                                                                                   |
| `spreadsheet.workerUrl`        | Custom Spreadsheet Worker URL. The default candidate is `vendor/xlsx/sheet.worker.js` under the current deployment base.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `spreadsheet.resizableColumns` | Enables drag resizing on spreadsheet column headers. Defaults to `false` for backward-compatible interactions; the official demo enables it by default for long text inspection.                                                                                          |
| `pdf.streaming`                | PDF URL loading strategy. Same-origin streaming is enabled by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `pdf.rangeChunkSize`           | PDF.js Range request chunk size.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `pdf.workerUrl`                | Custom PDF.js Worker URL for private, offline, or strict-CSP deployments. Defaults to the self-hosted viewer asset path under the current deployment base.                                                                                                                |
| `typst.compilerWasmUrl`        | Custom Typst compiler WASM URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `typst.rendererWasmUrl`        | Custom Typst SVG renderer WASM URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `hooks`                        | Lifecycle hooks for load and unload events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `beforeOperation`              | Guard before download, print, HTML export, or zoom actions. Return `false` to cancel.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Vanilla JavaScript and React integrations use `onEvent` to receive lifecycle and operation events. Svelte also emits `viewerEvent`; Vue packages map the same lifecycle and operation payloads to native component events and can also pass hooks through `options`.

## Printing, Exporting, and Watermarks

- Download keeps the original file bytes. It does not write rendered output back into the source file.
- Print opens a print-only document containing the rendered body and watermark, without the demo shell or host UI.
- PDF print and HTML export use a dedicated adapter that renders complete pages rather than only the visible canvas.
- Word print and HTML export preserve the white paper surface and page sizing while removing preview-only layout wrappers.
- Spreadsheet, archive, email, EPUB, audio, video, and 3D pipelines hide unreliable print buttons when the full document cannot be printed consistently.
- HTML export clones the current rendered output and converts canvas content where possible.

## Document Comparison

The production demo includes a standalone comparison page:

[https://demo.file-viewer.app/compare.html](https://demo.file-viewer.app/compare.html)

It supports two-pane document preview, built-in samples, URL input, local upload, swapping panes, reset, and synchronized scrolling. The comparison page is intentionally separate from the main viewer entry so that the primary component API stays small and predictable.

## Private Deployment

For native component package integrations, install the matching npm package in your application. If you also want to self-host worker, WASM, and sample assets, keep the copied asset directory intact:

```txt
file-viewer/assets/*
file-viewer/flyfish-viewer-assets.json        # generated by file-viewer-copy-assets
file-viewer/vendor/libarchive/worker-bundle.js  # optional unless you want a static Worker path
file-viewer/vendor/libarchive/libarchive.wasm   # keep next to worker-bundle.js when using archive.workerUrl
```

The open-source main repository also contains:

| Path              | Purpose                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dist/`           | Minified Vue 3 library build artifacts copied from `packages/components/vue3/dist` |
| `demo/`           | Static production demo, including `index.html` and `compare.html`                  |
| `component-demo/` | Vanilla JavaScript and React integration demo                                      |
| `docs/`           | Static documentation site output                                                   |
| `example/`        | Sample files used by the demo                                                      |

## Docker

The project provides a static nginx static image and build scripts for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. A typical deployment can serve the demo and comparison page directly:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 flyfishdev/file-viewer:latest
```

Then open:

```txt
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/compare.html
```

If you build the image yourself, use the provided `Dockerfile` and keep the static viewer assets, examples, and vendor WASM files together.

## Public Source and Aggregate Workspace

This public repository now carries the open-source core, demo, standard component packages, compatibility aliases, documentation source, build output, sample files, documentation output, and npm tarballs. The Gitee mirror is synchronized from a clean latest snapshot when needed, so domestic users can clone the full expanded repository without inheriting oversized binary release history.

The private Gitea workspace remains valuable as the complete aggregate repository with unified release automation, integration history, sponsorship, and priority support:

[https://dev.flyfish.group/shop](https://dev.flyfish.group/shop)

The shop is now a lemonade-level sponsorship and priority support channel. Public GitHub repositories stay split by package; the private aggregate workspace is still useful for teams that want one consolidated source tree and faster maintainer help.

## License and Attribution

Flyfish Viewer is distributed under the Apache-2.0 license. You may use the public source and release artifacts according to that license.

For second development or commercial use, please keep clear attribution to Flyfish Viewer and contribute useful fixes or compatibility improvements back whenever possible. This keeps the preview ecosystem healthier for everyone using the component in real business systems.
